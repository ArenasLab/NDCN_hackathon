Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (CZI NDCN) CompBio Office Hours 

## Hackathon Summary, June 26, 2020
*We’re using the word “hackathon” here to mean working together on something computational that perhaps isn’t any single person’s responsibility, but benefits everyone in the lab.*

Today we had a [CZI NDCN](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/neurodegeneration-challenge/) mini hackathon. It was led by Julie Lowndes (@jules32) and Oliver Tam (@olivertam). The goals of the hackathon were to:

1. Work hands-on with the Arenas Lab to check that file are named correctly according to a convention used/to be used by the lab, using R, RStudio, & RMarkdown 
2. Discuss and test ideas for how to build from this experience towards streamlining their lab workflow
3. Create a supportive space where we feel safe and empowered learning together
